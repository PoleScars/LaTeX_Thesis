Note: Weakly bonded structures have greater free energy slopes due to the large Cp/T dT value
Assume typical glass bonding Ionic
Assume typical solid bonding Covalent
Covalent > Ionic bond strength.
Thus solid slope < glass
Glass Tg changes because H and Cp is dependent on cooling rate (i.e. its free energy line is not rigidly defined).

Glass is metastable structure with greater free energy than the crystal state {Ishii, 2014 #147}
& Structure does not possess the required kinetic energy to transform into the equilibrium state
Gibbs Free Energy – Lower free energy means a process is more spontaneous. Therefore via thermos crystal is more
stable than glass.

Maybe more this down to the processing section.

Hardness is tired to wear residence in a few source. Can probably add in those sources.

The cooling rate achieved are estimated to be as much as 100K within the rotational relaxation time of the material
(molecules)! (i.e. fractions of a second!) {Ishii, 2014 #147}

Note in PLD, the Target atoms are the plasma. (Different from Sputtering). Therefore electrons must re-bond once
atoms are deposited onto substrate.
Page 9: Commented Scott Gleason 5/05/2015 10:55:00
The voltage potential between the substrate and target supplies excess electrons to the negative target. The
electrons are attracted to the positive substrate but collide with Ar atoms on their journey. This cause Ar to lose an
electron and to become a plasma (Ar+ & e-). Ar+ collide with the target, and releases M atoms from the target. (Note
e- has too little momentum to eject atoms from substrate).
Thus the M atoms are neutral charge (not plasma) because they are not being impacted by electrons in the field.
Page 9: Commented Scott Gleason 5/05/2015 16:00:00
Because the Target and Substrate gap is not insulted, like in a capacitor, current can flow between the two. Providing
the electrons as detailed above.

Advantage of Sputtering is higher pressure than PLD. Maybe a better way to word this.

Find more sources to back this up.
Jake got closer to this conclusion, but did not quite make it.
Page 11: Commented Scott Gleason 26/06/2014 17:41:00
Can you do this to make it clear these are ‘combination sputtering’ references?
Or do they have to go at the end of the sentence where this information will be lost?

SMG corrosion has not been studied!!!
Page 11: Commented Scott Gleason 24/11/2014 14:38:00
Can probably cut this so next section is less redundant
Page 12: Commented Scott Gleason 25/06/2014 12:14:00
Dawson reference other papers before this, but made the conclusion. Can I site him, or should I go to his source
material?
Check the “Tg & Tf paper” as it should have first principles reference to this.

Organic glasses are carbon based, molecular are Si or other elements.

Crystallisation is exothermic because the LRO has a lower free energy than SRO glass (So the transformation releases
energy).
Solid to liquid causes an increase in rate of change of free energy, hence it is endothermic.
Page 13: Commented Scott Gleason 6/05/2015 14:02:00
Melting of solid to liquid is an endothermic reaction (i.e. heat needs to be supplied to the reaction).
Page 13: Commented Scott Gleason 28/05/2015 17:20:00
Free energy always decreases.
Tg to Tx reduces energy as there are kinetics for atoms to move to lowest energy state.
Tx to Tm/Tl reduces energy because Liquid free energy line has greater rate of change than solid.

Find a proper/ full definition of Tf!
Page 13: Commented Scott Gleason 1/10/2014 16:23:00
Tf measures enthalpy. I.e. High Tf means higher enthalpy.

Technically this may be Organic (Figure of the molecular structure has C-rings).

“Tk is usually determined by extrapolation of supercooling liquid entropy to the temperature where S(liquid) =
S(crystal)” {Angell, 2014 #131}
Page 15: Commented Scott Gleason 30/06/2014 14:12:00
Have some other references around this point. Should have a look at them.
Page 16: Commented Scott Gleason 1/10/2014 16:26:00
Tf was used in enthalpy before
Should this be ‘enthalpy’ instead of ‘entropy’?
Page 16: Commented Scott Gleason 27/05/2015 14:20:00
Angell invented this relationship in old paper. Should use it more as source on m. {Angell, 1995 #164}
Page 19: Commented Scott Gleason 29/09/2014 11:57:00
Assuming this based on the definition.
Page 19: Commented Scott Gleason 5/01/2015 14:59:00
Normal Glasses only has SRO
Crystals have LRO (Donald S. of MIT)
So MRO is not a typical situation.

Anode and Cathode charges are opposite to Sputtering because this reaction releases voltage, like a battery, while
sputtering draws voltage.
Page 22: Commented Scott Gleason 21/11/2014 11:21:00
May not be the reason. May have to do with electron flow. Re-read Jones Chapter 3 to see what it says.

i.e. The Potential is a larger number
( -1.0 V < -0.5 V)

Very similar alloy. Thus trend should hold for Mg65Zn30Ca5
Page 25: Commented Scott Gleason 5/01/2015 15:55:00
Expect pitting may be less in SMGs, because despite higher density being expected, the surface finish may be higher
quality with less defects…

Probably will be much closer to the 50 W end (Jake topped out at 55 W).
MgCaZn has more light elements near Ar than ZrCuNiAl.
Therefore expect greater deposition efficiencies and to not require as much power.
ZrCuNiAl used 50 – 150 W, but we cannot get power that high unless we use 3 inch targets (not practical).
