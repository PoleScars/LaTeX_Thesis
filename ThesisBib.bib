	OPTabstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d<r2>dT(<r2> is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

	abstract = {This paper is written as a challenge to the ultrastable glass community to distinguish phenomenologically between the fast landscape searching scenario under discussion in the ultrastable glass community, and the alternative scenario in which the material in the ultrastable state is actually an attempted realization of the low temperature ideal glass phase of the system that can be reached in some systems, like ST2 water and amorphous silicon, and model systems like the attractive Jagla model, by a first order thermodynamic transition. These are special in that they exhibit first order phase transitions to the ground state that are accessible above the normal Tg of the high temperature phase — and in consequence exhibit vanishingly small excess entropies over crystal, and none of the “ubiquitous” glassy state cryogenic anomalies. In particular we show how, near a liquid–liquid critical point, the diffusivity can decrease arbitrarily rapidly over several orders of magnitude and that a growth front transformation from ultraslow phase to normal viscous liquid will be very difficult to distinguish from nucleation and growth of a new phase of different mobility.},

	abstract = {Bulk metallic glasses have attracted considerable attention over the last decades for their outstanding mechanical features (high strength, super-elasticity) and physico-chemical properties (corrosion resistance). Recently, some attempts to assign such original behavior from bulk materials to modified surfaces have been reported in the literature based on multicomponent alloys. In this paper we focused on the opportunity to form a metallic glass coating from the binary Zr–Cu system using a magnetron co-sputtering physical vapor deposition process. The composition of the films can be easily controlled by the relative intensities applied to both pure targets, which made possible the study of the whole Zr–Cu system (from 13.4 to 85.0 at.% Cu). The chemical composition of the films was obtained by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and their microstructure was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The thermal stability of the films was deduced from an in situ X-ray diffraction analysis (from room temperature up to 600 °C) and correlated with the results of the differential scanning calorimetry technique. Their mechanical properties were determined by nanoindentation experiments.},

	OPTabstract = {Amorphous metals, or bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), based on the Mg-Zn-Ca ternary alloy system, are an emerging class of material that offer many improvements over conventional crystalline magnesium alloys. These materials present a very real possibility of replacing current metallic and polymeric implant materials in a variety of roles. However, there is a general lack of understanding in these alloys, particularly in regard to their degradation processes. The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential of these newly discovered amorphous Mg-Zn-Ca alloys to be used as a bioresorbable biomaterial. The thesis began by focusing on a promising BMG composition, Mg65Zn30Ca5. The evaluation of its degradation and associated effects on cell viability provided a quantitative baseline for the subsequent work. However, its poor thermoplastic formability prompted the exploration of other BMG compositions within the Mg-Zn-Ca ternary system. A range of Mg-rich and Ca-rich BMG compositions were systematically explored. Although Ca-rich BMGs exhibited superior thermoplastic formability compared to the Mg-rich BMGs, they underwent rapid dissolution in biocorrosion environments. By enriching Ca-rich BMGs with Zn, their corrosion potential was enobled, but the corrosion rate remained high. Nevertheless, the amount of hydrogen evolved was low considering the degree of corrosion. Mg-rich BMGs on the other hand contain significantly less Ca, the most reactive element within the alloy. As such, Mg-rich BMGs exhibited superior corrosion resistance, and signs of passive corrosion kinetics. The interaction between the elements Mg, Zn, Ca was found to be very complex. The monotonic increase in Zn content in both Ca-rich and Mg-rich BMGs did not guarantee an improvement in their corrosion resistance. This suggested that the corrosion rate was not solely determined by the Zn content but, rather, the combination of Mg:Zn:Ca ratio. Overall, the results and findings from this research furthered our understanding on the amorphous Mg-Zn-Ca alloys. Quantitative data on the in-vitro performance of a range of amorphous alloy were amongst the first to be reported. This newly attained data and knowledge may be used to support the technological push to use bioresorbable metals in biomedical applications, as well as critically assess their suitability.},

In parallel, the characteristic analysis of these ZrCuAlNiV and ZrTiAlNiV alloy thin films including surface roughness, and corrosion resistance were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and tested by electrochemical method as well as salt spray testing, respectively. The results showed that the ZrCuAlNiV thin film exhibits a typical amorphous microstructure and smooth surface with average roughness about 1 nm. The ZrCuAlNiV thin film performs similar corrosion resistance to 304 stainless steel according to the result of salt spray testing in 5% NaCl solution. Additionally, the AC impedance value of ZrCuAlNiV is 20 times than 316L stainless steel and 4 times than ZrTiAlNiV, implying that the ZrCuAlNiV thin film has better corrosion resistance than the others owing to its amorphous state.},

With the application of ramping load, the critical load of about 110 mN was determined, at which the coefficient of friction increased sharply and the indenter penetration depth reached the film thickness. No clear evidence of film debonding was found, which, together with the observation of multiple shear bands, indicated good adhesion and ductility of the metallic-glass film. When subjected to constant loads, the coefficient of friction increased rapidly once the critical load was passed. The scratch results and the scanning-electron microscopy observations demonstrated good adhesion between the film and the substrate, which may be due to the good interfacial bonding and low residual stress in the film.},

	volume = {258},
	number = {1–4},
	pages = {217-224},
	abstract = {Metallic glasses are a different category of materials that are characterized by their amorphous structure and metallic bonds. Owing to their disordered structure, metallic glasses possess several unique properties that make them attractive for tribological applications. This paper deals with an in depth investigation into the two-body abrasive wear behaviour of several compositions of Fe, Co and Ni based metallic glasses while rubbing against metallographic grade SiC abrasive papers. Identical studies have also been carried out on crystalline cold-rolled AISI 304 stainless steel for comparison. Two-body abrasive wear results indicate that wear characteristics of different metallic glasses are marginally superior or similar to that of stainless steel. The wear in Ni based metallic glass MBF 35 is significantly higher than that in stainless steel. This is inspite of the fact that metallic glasses are considerably harder than stainless steel. Scratch indentation and acoustic emission studies (AE) were carried out with a view to understanding the mechanisms of occurrence of two-body abrasive wear in metallic glasses. Scratched surfaces of metallic glasses indicated the presence of arc-like features that in some cases extend well beyond the scratched groove edges. In the case of Ni based metallic glass MBF 35, cracking on the surface was clearly visible. In stainless steel, the grooves formed were neatly cut out and were free from the arc-like features. During scratch tests on metallic glasses, AE signals were obtained but no AE signals were generated during scratch tests on steel. Presence of arc-like features on scratched surfaces in metallic glasses are tensile micro-cracks formed due to brittle fracture owing to their poor ductility in tension. These results revealed that the abrasive wear of metallic glasses is not commensurate to their high hardness and occurrence of micro-cracking results in their poor abrasive wear resistance.},

	abstract = {Ultrastable glasses and nanoglasses are two emerging materials with novel properties that have been investigated separately. In order to explore the combined effect of ultrastable character and a nanoglass with a nanoglobular microstructure on the kinetic behavior, the glass transition and crystallization behaviors of an ultrastable nanoglass and a melt-spun ribbon of Au-based metallic glass were examined by differential scanning calorimetry at heating rates (ϕ) of up to 40,000 K s−1. The nanoglass shows ultrastable kinetic characters at low ϕ (e.g. 300 K s−1) and similar kinetic behaviors at high ϕ (e.g. 30,000 K s–1) compared to the melt-spun ribbon. The nanoglobular interfaces remain amorphous and appear to act as a kinetic constraint to induce a higher crystallization temperature compared to the melt-spun ribbon. The interface constraint effect disappears at 30,000 K s−1. These results indicate that the nanoglobular microstructure can act to increase metallic glass stability and provide another mechanism for the synthesis of ultrastable glass.},
